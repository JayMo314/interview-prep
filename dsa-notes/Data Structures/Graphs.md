## Basic Graph Theory
- A graph is a tree if:
	- it is fully connected 
	- there are no cycles 
- For a graph to be a tree it must have exactly `n-1` edges 
## Advanced Graph Theory
#### Cut Theory
- A "cut" is a set of edges that divides the graph into two disjoint sets of nodes. This set of "cuts" is called a **Cut Set**
- The smallest weighted edge in a cut set will be in the MST of a graph. This is the basis of Kruskal's Algorithm
