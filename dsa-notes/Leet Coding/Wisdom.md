- Identify brut force first and then improve. Make sure you correctly identify brut force time complexity. 
- N^2 is ok if it's an improvement.
- try to come up with test cases that demonstrate the full nature of the problem
- use the properties of the problem. If it's a geometry problem, use geometry solutions. don't force it to be graph problem.
