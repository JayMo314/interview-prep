### One Liner
- Relax all edges of a node while using a priority queue to choose the next node to process, a visited set to ignore previously processed nodes, and an array to store distances for each node. 
### Notes
- The result of Dijkstra's is the min cost to reach each node from the source node
- Dijkstra's algorithm is essentially incrementing all possible paths from `src` to `dst` and the least expensive path will reach the `dst` first
